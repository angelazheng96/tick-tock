# Tick, Tock...

A simple stopwatch and timer website. For years, I've been looking for a stopwatch/timer that is (1) simple, (2) pretty, and (3) ad-free. Then, I remembered that I can just make one myself!

## Development
Built with Astro, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS in around 4 hours.

Now that I'm familiar with both of these, it was a lot less painful to get started. I struggled mostly with the timer code logic and how to best make the timer input feel intuitive and aesthetic at the same time.
